# SMACSS & Sass WP theme

SMACSS & Sass WP is a starter theme for Wordpress. It's actually a fork of [_s theme](http://underscores.me) with some cool features from [Smacss & Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/luzlol/smacss-sass-boilerplate) which is using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), [Compass](http://compass-style.org) and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net) grid toolkit.

The theme uses [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) style guide to structure code (in this case SCSS-files). You should definitely use only `style.css` in production though =).
